    <h1>Hello From Australia</h1>
    <p>Dear Friend,</p>
    <p>How are you doing? I have been having the best time exploring the rainforests of Australia.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow I am planning on snorkeling at the Great Barrier Reef!</p>
    <p>I have brought my coding practice with me, so I don't forget all that I have learned so far.</p>
    <p>Friend, you would not believe how beautiful it is here. You should come with me next time. I can't wait to move here and write code on the beach! </p>
    <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. </p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
    <p>Code and Travel Enthusiast Jane</p>
